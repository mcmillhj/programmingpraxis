;; This sorting algorithm derives its name from the game of Patience (thatâ€™s the British name, we call it Solitaire in the United States) 
;; because it is implemented by analogy to sorting a shuffled deck of cards:
;;
;; Starting with no piles, add the next card from the deck to the first pile with top card greater than the next card from the deck. 
;; If the next card from the deck is greater than the top card of all the piles, start a new pile. 
;; When the deck is exhausted, collect the cards in order by selecting the smallest visible card at each step.
;;
;; For instance, consider sorting the list (4 3 9 1 5 2 7 8 6). 
;; The first stack gets 4 and 3. Since 9 is larger than 3, it starts a second stack, 1 goes on the first stack, then 5 and 2 go on the second stack. 
;; At this point the first stack (top to bottom) consists of (1 3 4), the second stack consists of (2 5 9), and the remaining deck consists of (7 8 6). 
;; Now 7 goes on a third stack, 8 goes on a fourth stack, and 6 goes on top of the 7 in the third stack. 
;; With all the cards dealt: 
;;    1 is collected from the first stack, 2 from the second stack, 3 and 4 from the first stack, 5 from the second stack, 
;;    6 and 7 from the third stack, 8 from the fourth stack, and 9 from the second stack. 
;; The algorithm has complexity O(n log n).
;;
;; Your task is to implement the patience sorting algorithm. 
;; When you are finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
