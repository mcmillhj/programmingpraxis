(* The Skyline Puzzle is a classic programming exercise; 
   it draws a silhouette of a city skyline by blocking out portions of buildings that are masked by taller buildings. 
   A city is a list of buildings specified as triples containing left edge, height, and right edge. 
   For instance, the list of triples 
      (1 11 5) (2 6 7) (3 13 9) (12 7 16) (14 3 25) (19 18 22) (23 13 29) (24 4 28) encodes the eight buildings shown at the left of the diagram, 
   and the path 
      1 11 3 13 9 0 12 7 16 3 19 18 22 3 23 13 29 0 encodes the skyline shown at the right of the diagram, 
   where the odd-indexed elements of the output are the x-coordinate of the skyline and the even-indexed elements of the output are the y-coordinate of the skyline. 
   (It makes more sense to me that the output should look like (1 11) (3 13) (9 0) (12 7) (16 3) (19 18) (22 3) (23 13) (29 0) but thatâ€™s not the way the puzzle is ever specified.) 
   
   Notice that the second (2 6 7) and eighth (24 4 28) buildings are not part of the skyline.
